# OpenF2A
This repository presents a fully coupled framework for the dynamic analysis of floating wind energy systems (wind turbine, wind-wave hybrid concepts) based on OpenFAST and AQWA, which acts as a continuous work of F2A that has been extensively used in the design of floating offshore wind turbines, and wind-wave hybrid concepts. OpenFAST v4.0.0 is used for the development of OpenF2A. The later versions of OpenF2A will be renamed following the version of OpenFAST, to be simply identified by users which version of OpenFAST case files should be used in OpenF2A simulations. For instance, the OpenF2A will be named as OpenF2A v4.0.0 if OpenFAST v4.0.0 is used.

Please note that the precompiled DLL and regression tests are currently available. The source code will be publicly released once the paper entitled "Development, Validation and Extended Applicability of a Novel Open-Source Fully Coupled Framework for Floating Wind Energy Systems" is accepted by the journal. We submitted the paper to a peer-reviewed journal on 17-Nov-2025. Hopefully, it will be accepted shortly.
